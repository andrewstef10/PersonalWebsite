        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi! my name is Andrew Stefkovich and I am a junior at Virginia Tech majoring in Computer Science. I have 
          a strong background in many object oriented programming languages and also have experience in both front and back end software development.
          I have build the front and back end of a tic tac toe game in Java.
          Another project I have completed was building a MIPS assembler which converts MIPS assembly instructions to 32-bit machine instructions.
          I am apart of Hokie Electric Vehicle Team at Virginia Tech where I will be working on writing programs needed to improve vehicle
          subsystems as well as install an electric rear drive train on a 2023 Cadillac Lyric provided by GM.
          I am seeking an internship related to software engineering / development for this coming summer.
          </p>
